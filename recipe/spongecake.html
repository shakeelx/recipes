    <h2>What Is Victoria Sponge Cake?</h2>
    <p>
      A Victoria sponge cake (a.k.a. a Victoria sandwich) is a British dessert
      that consists of jam and cream sandwiched between two delicate cake
      layers. The dish gets its name from Queen Victoria, who is said to have
      made a habit of enjoying the cake with her afternoon tea.
